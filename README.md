# Finguard

Finguard is a project dedicated to the conservation of exotic and endangered fish species. Its goal is to facilitate the sustainable fishing practices by providing fishermen with information about fish species that are safe to hunt and fish, thus contributing to the preservation of marine biodiversity.

## Objective

The main objective of Finguard is to promote the conservation of exotic and endangered fish species by offering fishermen a platform where they can access reliable information about which fish species are safe to catch without endangering their populations.

## How It Works

Finguard achieves its goal by:

1. Providing a database of fish species along with their current conservation status.
2. Offering information on the locations where these fish species can be found.
3. Advising fishermen on sustainable fishing practices and suggesting alternative species to target.

## Contribution to UN Sustainable Development Goals

Finguard directly contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (UN SDG) 14: Life Below Water, by promoting the conservation and sustainable use of marine resources. By helping fishermen make informed decisions about which fish species to target, Finguard supports efforts to protect marine biodiversity and ensure the long-term health of our oceans.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
